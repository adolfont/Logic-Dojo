Objective
-----------------------------------------------

The objective with this experiment is to build an 
[analytical tableaux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux) prover for classical propositional
logic.

It will receive as input a sequence of signed formulas and it will output a proof tree.
